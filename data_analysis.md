## [Clustering Analysis of Statewide Health Insurance Marketplaces](https://markdowntutorial.com/)
  
*Sept 2022 - Dec 2022*  
*R Studio*

• Conducted data cleaning on a 2019 plan-level health insurance dataset from the United States using **Stata**, ensuring that the data was accurate and 
  ready for analysis.  
• Explored the dataset to analyze geographic variations in health insurance marketplaces and identify patterns and trends using statistical methods.  
• Conducted state-level **clustering analysis** and used **ggplot** to identify ideological variations in insurance plans, highlighting the importance of 
  customized visualization tools in data analysis.  
• Found large differences in plan policies in the marketplaces between states, aligning with the initial hypothesis, and used data-driven insights to 
  better understand the factors driving these differences.  
• Attempted to predict state health insurance coverage rate on a contemporary level, demonstrating a commitment to using data-driven insights to inform 
  policy decisions and improve healthcare outcomes. Results showed that while large variations exist in health insurance structure, they do not have a 
  significant effect on evidence-based care, underscoring the importance of data-driven decision making in healthcare policy.

This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
