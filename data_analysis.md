• Conducted data cleaning and exploration on a 2019 plan-level health insurance dataset from the United States, ensuring that the data was accurate and ready for analysis.  
• Explored the dataset to analyze geographic variations in health insurance marketplaces and identify patterns and trends using statistical methods.  
• Conducted state-level **clustering analysis** and used **ggplot** to identify ideological variations in insurance plans, highlighting the importance of customized visualization tools in data analysis.  
• Found large differences in plan policies in the marketplaces between states, aligning with the initial hypothesis, and used data-driven insights to better understand the factors driving these differences.  
• Attempted to predict state health insurance coverage rate on a contemporary level, and results showed that while large variations exist in health insurance structure, they do not have a significant effect on evidence-based care, underscoring the importance of data-driven decision making in healthcare policy.
