Hello World !  
   
My name is Wanlin Chen, a.k.a. the Queen of Caffeine, Hiker Extraordinaire, and Gym Rat.  
   
Armed with a Master of Science in Spatial Economics and Data Analysis from the University of Southern California, I’m ready to conquer the world, one cup of coffee at a time !   

When I’m not crunching numbers or crunching abs, you can find me hitting the trails and soaking up the California sun. So grab a cup of coffee, lace up your hiking boots, and let’s explore the world of data together !
