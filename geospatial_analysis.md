**[The Effect of COVID-19 on Housing Prices in New York City](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8ae61f1122aa46c1b210ec9923f5656b)**  
*Oct 2022 - Dec 2022*
<br>
<br>
• Conducted an in-depth analysis of housing prices in New York City by utilizing data from 19,686 house points in 2020.  
• Utilized **exploratory data analysis** techniques to gain insights into the data, such as identifying trends, patterns, and outliers.  
• Examined the impact of COVID-19-induced demographic composition (age and education), socioeconomic condition (income and employment) and parks closure policy on housing prices, informing policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders about the current state and future trends of the New York City housing market.  
• Compared performances of four spatial models to select the most appropriate model for the analysis, and implemented **Spatial Lag Regimes Model (SLRM)** with location dummies to address spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity in the data.
• Created an interactive story map to visually display the findings to readers.

**[Assess Accessibility to Pediatric Healthcare Services of San Francisco County](https://markdowntutorial.com/)**    
*Feb 2021 - Apr 2021*
<br>
<br>
• Applied the US Census dataset and Healthcare Facilities dataset to examine the current spatial accessibility of pediatricians in San Francisco.
• Created a 15-minute driving catchment area and estimated the accessibility using **the 2 step Floating Catchment Area method (2SFCA)** for supply and demand area.
• Stressed the importance of considering non-spatial factors and choosing a bigger catchment area to obtain more accurate results to address the **Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)**.
• Concluded that this project aimed to assess spatial accessibility to pediatric services in San Francisco and that the results required careful interpretation due to the limitations of the study.
• Indicated the uneven distribution of Pediatric healthcare services in San Francisco as a result of children population pattern, highlighting the need for better access to pediatric services in underserved areas.
• Emphasized the importance of targeted healthcare policies and interventions to address healthcare disparities.
